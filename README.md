# Term 1 Assignment 3 - Terminal Application

## Idea
The idea of this project to create a word game, similar to "Wordle", this will however be able to be used as many times a day rather than only once a day.

## Objective 
The player is needing to select a word and get the word in the least amount of attempts, there will be 7 attempts and 6 letter words.

## Features
The features that I have displayed are;

### Color Indicators
- Green: To display that the letter of the word that you have chosen is correct position.
- Blue: To display that the letter of the word that you have chosen is in the word, however not in the correct position.
- Grey: To display the letter is not in the word.

### Scoring
- Scoring will be done is two ways;
    - Percentage;
        - How successful the player has been with getting the word
    - Total of attempts;
        - How many times someone has got the word in the attemps

### Hard mode
- Having the ability to be able to do it in hard mode, instead of the player being able to guess any word, they will either need to;
    - If there is a letter that has been used and it is grey, they are unable to use it again
    - If there is a letter that is green or blue, they are needing to use this letter.
        - the objective of this is for the user to not be able to use a filler word.


<!-- Potential other features wanting -->
<!-- To have a dictonary meaning of all the words available -->
<!-- Score list (percentile of how many times the player got the word correct) -->
